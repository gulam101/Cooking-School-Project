### Description: 

This project I did for my level 4 HNC course for multi-media. For this project, I had to build a website that would be submitted to the assignment. During this design I had to do research into building a website and I had to pick a theme. For the theme of the website I went with a cooking website that would be focused on classes and online classes. 

For the core element of the website I went with the cooking theme in the end because I already had some research to begin with. I do admit I had no idea how I was going to lay it out since I didnâ€™t want to spend too much time on the website. For inspiration I did look at a few website layouts that shared a similar theme to my design.

I went with plain CSS and jQuery because I didn't need to use antyhing else to complete the website. Everything worked fine and I used manual-tetsing to make sure that featueres worked fine.

### Prerequisites:
- Any Modern Browser (Preferably Chrome or Firefox)
- Any IDE to view code (Preferably VS Code or Brackets)
- Access to developer tools on web browser

### Instructions:
- Step 1: Load Up IDE (If you don't have one use this: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)
- Step 2: Clone project or download from GitHub
- Step 3: Load up project in IDE
- Step 4: Right click on the .html file and click Live Server

### What I learned:
- Better understanding of Flexbox
- Better understanding of jQuery
- Not repeating lines in CSS code
- Inheriting same functions of CSS code
- Better commenting on code

### Constraints:
I had a few issues such as in the navbar (menu) there was supposed to be icons that would be next the menu and they would display inidcaiting to the user, however this did not work. Coolfonts API did not work correclty and instead would not show any of the icons refardlkess if they were free or not. In the end I had to scrap that design and place the fonts in the footer menu. 

I had used jQuery modal and I used an API that would do most of the work for me, however I realised I used this twice for a sign-up link and for a the classes page that would let the user click on the images and it would show off the information. In my attempt to get a sign-up button I had broken the modal for the classes page and this meant that it would not display correctly, so instead I had to remove the information.
